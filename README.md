# RPM packages

Even tho Fedora has a very wide range of packages available throught the
official repositories and RPMFusion, there are sometimes some packages that are
missing. I've made rpm specs for them here and build them using copr.

Not all packages are equally important to me and some of them I might not update
very often. Here is a list of the ones are to be expected to be up to date.

- [eclipse-java](./eclipse-java/)
- [eclipse-jee](./eclipse-jee/)
- [svetovid-lib](./svetovid-lib/)
- [morewaita-icon-theme](./morewaita-icon-theme/)
